  "summary": "Diff implements a new translucent header utility class and applies it to Landing and several dashboard pages, updates Landing hero headline to a two-line version, and introduces new login button components using the existing Internet Identity hook. However, the diff also includes multiple unrelated UI/theme/routing/page changes that were not requested, and it’s not fully evidenced that *all* “Masuk” login triggers across the app were fixed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-119",
      "requirement": "Reduce the Landing page hero headline font size so each sentence fits on a single line on typical mobile/desktop widths (no unintended wrapping beyond the explicit line break).",
      "reason": "The headline is updated to two lines via an explicit <br />, but the shown classes remain relatively large (text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl). The diff does not show additional measures (e.g., smaller sizes, max-width tuning, balance) to ensure the second sentence does not wrap on typical mobile widths.",

      "requirement": "Fix all \"Masuk\" / login buttons across the app so they correctly trigger the Internet Identity (II) login flow, and ensure login buttons handle logging-in state (disabled/loading) to prevent double-click issues.",
      "reason": "The diff shows a new MasukButton used on Landing and an updated AuthButton with disabled state during logging-in, but it does not provide evidence that every other login control across the app (any other \"Masuk\" buttons/links) was replaced/wired to the II login flow.",
